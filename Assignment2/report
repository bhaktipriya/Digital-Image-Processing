1. With increase in k(weight), sharp features are more enhanced coz you add more weight to the difference, while adding it back to the image.
With increase in w(window) size, sharp features are enhanced. This is because the blurred image now has a lot of loss of information (small kernel, rather fixed kernel size, and a lot of data). Subtracting the blurred from the original will give to much larger values of difference. Thus on adding the difference, we get a sharper image.


2.
   Gaussian(1)=upsampled(downsampled(gaussian(original))
   Gaussian(2)=upsampled(downsampled(gaussian(Gaussian(1)))
   Gaussian(3)=upsampled(downsampled(gaussian(Gaussian(2)))
	
   LP of main image, LP of bg image, G of mask.
   Build with these ..
   With more levels, blurring will be more so merging will be better.


3. 
8 bit integral image with double reconstruction, gives us the exact image.
8 bit integral image with uint8 reconstruction, leads to overflow of values, and doesnt give us the exact image.
2MN operations for integral image:
ii(x,y)=S(x,y)+ii(x,y-1)
Applications: Calculation of rectangular functions like avg intensity of a rect region.

4.
Changind wwindow- larger window better smoothening, but for higher vals you might loose edges
Changing sigma - smoother image
inverse bilateral filterring getting salient portions of the image

5.
image warping:

iterate over final image, and interpolate original to find the intensity for output
